<p align="justify"> Instructor - Prof. Preethi Jyothi, Dept of Computer Science, IIT Bombay <br><br>
- Reviewed literature on targeted, imperceptible, white & black-box adversarial attacks on the ASR systems
- Trained a Bi-RNN CTC-based network on the SpeechCommands dataset with a WER of 16%<br>
- Implemented Gradient-descent based adversarial attack achieving a 0% classification accuracy along with
a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 30dB in the perturbed audio examples</p>
