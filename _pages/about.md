Hello, I am Jay Sawant, an alumnus of the prestigious <a href = "https://www.iitb.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay</a>, where I earned a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Communication and Signal Processing. I am currently pursuing an MS degree in Data Science degree at <a href="https://ucsd.edu"> University of California, San Diego </a>
</p>


<p align="justify">My M.Tech thesis research at IIT Bombay centered on the exploration of deep learning applications in the fields of Histopathology and Medical Imaging. Specifically, I concentrated on advancing these domains by developing innovative techniques for the Quality Control of Whole Slide Images (WSI).</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, I am working as a Graduate Student Researcher at the Lab of Cognitive Imaging, UCSD Health, developing novel deep learning algorithms to detect Temporal Lobe Epilepsy in T1-weighted 3D brain MRIs.</p>
