- Trained a U-Net architecture for segmentation of the tumor region using the soft dice loss in MRI slices and
used a dataset consisting of around 4K MRI slices from 110 patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive <br>
- Achieved a mean IOU of 0.77 on the validation set between the predicted and the true segmentation masks of
tumor positive MRI slices and an accuracy of 96.8% on the binary classification of presence of tumor</p>
