<p align="justify"> Trained a U-Net architecture for segmentation of the tumour region using a softer version of the Dice Loss in MRI slices.
Used a Dataset consisting of around 4K MRI slices from 110 patients in TCGA collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive. 
Achieved an average IOU of 0.77 between the predicted and the true segmentation masks of tumour positive MRI slices.
Achieved an accuracy of 96.8% on the binary classification of presence of Tumour in Brain MRI slices from validation set</p>
