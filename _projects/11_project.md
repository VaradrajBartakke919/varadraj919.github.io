- Created a robust pipeline for the detection and classification of artifacts within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), employing four specialized models for identifying blur level, tissue fold, pen marker, and tissue segmentation.<br>
- Developed a comprehensive WSI profiling system by seamlessly integrating the results from the aforementioned four models, generating a refined and usable mask for analysis<br>
- Demonstrated exceptional performance by achieving a dice score exceeding 0.7 on 74% of the 11,529 WSIs from the TCGA dataset when comparing our profiler’s results to the standardized HistoQC’s usable masks</p>
