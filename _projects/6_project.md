- Used a 10-bit ADC MCP3008 as an interface between the LM35 temperature sensor and the Pt-51 microcontroller board <br>
- Displayed the real-time temperature on an LCD screen along with the average of past 10 measurements every new second<br>
- Built an alarm system with LEDs and a speaker to buzz when the temperature goes 2o C away from average temperature<br>
- Used embedded C language to create a flash-able HEX file onto the Pt-51 microcontroller using the Keil software by ARM</p>
