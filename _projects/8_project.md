- Employed an active learning approach to train the HistoROI classifier, effectively categorizing Whole Slide
Images (WSIs) into six tissue regions: epithelium, stroma, lymphocytes, adipose, artifacts, and miscellaneous <br>
- Evaluated by comparing the foreground predictions of our deep learning-based HistoROI model against the
image processing-based HistoQC tool and outperformed the later with a higher dice score on 70% of the WSIs<br>
- Enhanced HistoROI model performance for WSI segregation by implementing Contrastive Learning methods</p>
