<p align="justify"> We present a new integration system for layer-3 routers in programmable networks, which allows for the creation of a new forwarding node i.e the Super-Node. These nodes retain the traditional routing control plane from layer-3 routers. However, we replace the static data plane of the original routers by a new, programmable data plane. We create networks using these new forwarding nodes,
replacing erstwhile layer-3 routers. These new nodes allow for the creation of smarter data planes and customized control planes to implement traditional routing algorithms. </p>
