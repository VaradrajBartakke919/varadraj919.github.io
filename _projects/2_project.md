<p align="justify"> In this project, we present a model for a downstream news classification task on a multicategory news dataset. We develop the model using a Transformer based neural network architecture, which we use to classify the news items into its category labelled in the dataset. In the process, we discovered that classifcation of news across categories which overlap in context (e.g. entertainment and comedy) is extremely hard, even with the state-of-the-art word embeddings from Transformers.  </p>
