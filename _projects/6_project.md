<p align="justify"> This was a course project for the course Deep Learning at ETH Zurich, in Autumn 2021. Deep learning models for vision tasks have been shown to work well due to factors like inductive biases, generalization of models and so on. In this project, we explore the possible inductive biases or lack of them across different architectures used in vision tasks such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architectures. We present a series of experiments which help understand these inductive bias, and their role in helping these models generalize.</p>
