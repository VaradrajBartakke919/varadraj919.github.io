<p align="justify"> Instructor - Prof. Suyash Awate, Dept of Computer Science, IIT Bombay <br> <br>
- Trained a SFTMD Network which outputs a Hi-Res image by taking a low-res image & kernel as the inputs <br>
- Built a separate Predictor Network for Kernel prediction and a Corrector Network for fine-tuning the kernel <br>
- Low-resolution images were created by blurring HR images by a Gaussian kernel and then downscaling by 4x</p>
