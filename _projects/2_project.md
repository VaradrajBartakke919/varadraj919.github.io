- Utilized the CycleGAN model in Image translation to generate portraits preserving the human facial features <br>
- Proposed a perceptual loss to preserve facial features that uses FaceNet embeddings to guide the generators <br>
- Achieved an average SSIM of 0.98 using our approach between the human faces and their respective portraits </p>
